_Ever shown up to the beach expecting perfect conditions, only to find mushy closeouts or barely a ripple?

**Disclaimer:** The following is thoroughly unscientiffic and mostly based on surfing wisdom extracted from the author's dad over many years.

### What is a wave?

Breaking waves are created when wind-blown lumps of water on the ocean's surface (known as swell) move from deep to shallow water. This swell contains an amount of energy, which is stored as motion and gravitational potential in the water column below each swell lump. As the swell approaches shallow water, this energy must be stored in a decreasing volume of water, and the wave grows taller to compensate. At the same time, the base of the wave experiences a 'drag' on the bottom and slows down, throwing the crest forward like coffee in a braking car.

Roughly speaking, this is how breaking waves are formed. But as any surfer will know, they are not all created equal. Some days the surf laps at your ankles; other days you're tossed like a leaf. Some waves crumble anti-climactically while others coil into glassy barrels.

Why is this? And how can you predict what the waves will be like based on a forecast? There are three main factors at play here, and we'll start with swell.

### Swell

If there was a recipe for waves, swell would be the main ingredient. In a forecast, swell is usually described in terms of height, period and direction.

**Height and period**  
_Swell height_ is the most intuitive consideration - the bigger the swell, the bigger the waves. Swell height is usually measured as the vertical height from crest to trough in deep water. This is distinct from _wave height_, which is the height as the wave breaks. Waves can be up to 3 times taller than the swell that generated them, but this number varies based on factors including swell period, local [bathymetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathymetry) and wave energy dissipation. In order to compare apples to apples, swell height is often the preferred metric.

A less obvious factor is _swell period_. This is the time between consecutive wave crests in deep water. A longer period (e.g. 14+ seconds) means the waves have travelled further, carrying more energy and producing more powerful surf. Short-period swells (e.g. 4-8 seconds) tend to be weaker and more unpredictable.

**Direction**
Even if a solid swell is running, it may not produce good surf unless it's coming from the right angle for your spot. Following [Huygen's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle), swell will usually 'wrap in' to break parallel to the coastline, but it loses energy in the process.

Therefore, it is often important to consider the direction of swell relative to the angle and exposure of a break.

**Multiple swells**  
While forecasts often list a primary swell, there are usually multiple swells in the water at any given time. These can be generated by different storms, with varying directions, periods, and heights. When swells interact, they can either _reinforce_ each other (creating larger, more powerful waves) or _interfere_ (leading to messy, unpredictable surf). Long-period groundswells tend to dominate, but shorter-period wind swells can add chop or create secondary peaks.

### Wind

If swell is the main ingredient, wind is the seasoning. It can make or break the quality of the surf. Although wind plays a role in building swell way out at sea, we'll be focusing on how wind affects the surf at the coastline.

**Onshore vs offshore winds**  
The most critical distinction for surfers is between _offshore_ and _onshore_ winds.

- Offshore winds groom the incoming waves, holding up the face before they break. This produces clean, well-defined waves and often creates barrels.
- Onshore winds blow from the sea onto the land. They push against the back of the wave as it rears and breaks, causing it to crumble early and lose power and shape.

Light or offshore winds are the dream for many surfers, although strong offshore winds can make it more difficult to paddle in to waves, especially on bigger days.

**Why surfers get up so early**  
Wind forecasts are useful, but they often predict large-scale prevailing winds rather than the more localised patterns that can affect conditions at the beach. One pattern to keep in mind is the cycle of _sea breezes_ and _land breezes_.

- As the sun heats the land during the day, the air above it rises, pulling in cooler air from the ocean. This creates a localised onshore breeze (sea breeze) that typically strengthens throughout the daylight hours.
- Luckily for surfers, this effect is reversed overnight as the land cools. This flips the cycle, creating an offshore breeze (land breeze) that often continues into the early morning.

**Taking shelter**  
Even when a forecast predicts a strong onshore wind, local geography can create sheltered pockets where the wind has little impact. Cliffs, headlands, and dunes can block or redirect the wind, meaning that some breaks stay clean while others turn to mush.

**Forecasts as a guide**  
Because of these local wind variations, a forecast is just a guide. It helps to know your local spots and their unique wind patterns. Sometimes, a predicted onshore wind might hold off for an extra hour in the morning, or a strong cross-shore wind might be weaker in a protected bay.

### Bathymetry

We discussed how as waves move into shallower water, they slow down and steepen. However, the speed and nature of this transition depends on the slope of the seafloor. _Bathymetry_ from ancient greek bathús (deep) describes the contours of the sea floor, which can warp and refract waves, affecting their size and shape.

A gently sloping beach can cause waves to break more gradually, creating slow, spilling waves that are well-suited for beginners. When depth changes abruptly — such as over a reef or point break - waves can jack up faster and pitch violently, creating steep, fast surf. Generally, waves tend to be steeper at low tide - when they break in shallower water - and more mellow at high tide.

Underwater features can also magnify or diminish wave energy. Submarine canyons, such as those at Mavericks in California or Nazaré in Portugal, funnel swell energy to dramatically increase wave height. Sandbars can also bend or funnel swell at a smaller scale, shaping waves in different ways depending on their position and depth.

Since bathymetry varies from one break to another, understanding local seafloor conditions can be a major advantage. Some breaks work best on a particular tide, while others only come alive when swell arrives from a specific direction. Keeping an eye on sand movements and simply observing how waves behave under different conditions can help surfers anticipate when and where to find the best waves.

### Putting it all together

Surf forecasting might seem complex at first, but once you break it down into swell, wind, and bathymetry, the puzzle starts to make sense. Understanding how these factors interact allows you to make better-informed decisions about when and where to surf.

The best way to improve your forecasting skills is through experience. Check the forecast, make a prediction, then head to the beach and see how reality compares. Over time, you’ll learn how your local breaks respond to different conditions, when to trust the forecast, and when to trust your instincts. The wind and swell layers on [this website](https://www.windy.com/) are an easy way to get started.

At the end of the day, though, it’s about getting in the water, having fun, and enjoying the process. Even if the forecast turns out wrong and the waves aren’t ideal, there’s always something to be learned (or at the very least, an excuse for a post-surf coffee).
